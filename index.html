        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This is the website which introduces my Final Linux Project from Web
          Development course in Lodz University of Technology. Main objective of
          this project is to create two virtual machines, server and client,
          connect them via SSH protocol and show that it is possible, to access
          this website on the client machine.
        </p>

      <section id="preparation">
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          I began my final project by conducting research and outlining the
          steps required to achieve my ultimate goal: setting up a website
          showcasing my experience with SSH on a master-slave virtual machine
          configuration. This included managing files on my Ubuntu Server and
          documenting the process in a clear and structured manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I created and configured the first VM. In the process, I set
          the IP to the static:
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/1.png" />
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="openssh">
        <h2>Installing and Configuring OpenSSH</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, after the configuration, I applied the commands to enable the
          Firewall and tried to connect my first VM to my Windows device via
          cmd. It worked:
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/2.png" />
        </div>
        <p>I also tried via other devices, and it worked:</p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/3.png" />
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="ssh-connection">
        <h2>Establishing SSH Connection Between Client and Server</h2>
        <p>
          This division basically explains testing SSH locally on each VM and
          remotely between the client and server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right after creating the first VM and configuring everything
          successfully there, I created the second VM and set it up as a client.
          After the configuration process and checking the SSH on the client VM,
          I tried to connect the client to the server via ssh and succeeded.
          Hereâ€™s how it looked like:
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/4.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Next, I obviously tried to do the same but from the Master machine.
          Here's how it looked like:
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/5.png" />
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="putty">
        <h2>Installing PuTTY</h2>
        <p>
          At this stage, almost everything was already done, but nor PuTTY
          configuration. So, after playing with my servers for a while I went to
          the necessary link and installed PuTTY on my PC. Instantly, I saved
          needed addresses and tried to connect using SSH.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/6.png" />
        </div>
        <p>PuTTY connection window looked pretty much like other windows:</p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/7.png" />
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="hosting">
        <h2>Building and Hosting the Website</h2>
        <p>As a final step, I installed Apache in the server:</p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/8.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Then, created this website ðŸ––:</p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="static/img/9.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          And using few commands and my newly created
          <a
            href="https://github.com/IhorHuz/finalweb/tree/main"
            target="_blank"
            >github repository</a
          >
          delivered the necessary files to the server.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding
          of SSH and website hosting. Through careful planning, configuration,
          and testing, I successfully established secure communication between
          virtual machines and deployed this website on an Apache server. The
          journey not only enhanced my technical skills but also allowed me to
          apply theoretical knowledge in a practical and meaningful way. By
          documenting the entire process, I created a valuable resource for
          others interested in similar setups. This accomplishment marks a
          significant milestone in my Web Development course and serves as a
          foundation for future learning and exploration in server management
          and networking.
